<p class="paragraph">I developed a passion for writing code when I started learning Java in 2019. Whether it's for applications or video games, I enjoy programming and hope to contribute my skills to many more projects in the future.</p>
<p class="paragraph">When I need a break from debugging, I like to play video games, draw in Photoshop, or read fantasy novels.</p>
